A simple self introductory  retail data analysis using spark and scala.

**Retail**  is the process of selling  [consumer goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_goods "Consumer goods")  or  [services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_(economics) "Service (economics)")  to customers through multiple  [channels of distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_channel "Distribution channel")  to earn a profit.  **Retailers**  satisfy demand identified through a  [supply chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain "Supply chain"). The term "retailer" is typically applied where a service provider fills the small orders of a large number of individuals, who are end-users, rather than large orders of a small number of  [wholesale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wholesale "Wholesale"),  [corporate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate "Corporate")  or government clientele.  [Shopping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shopping "Shopping")  generally refers to the act of  [buying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade "Trade")  products. Sometimes this is done to obtain  [final goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_goods "Final goods"), including necessities such as food and clothing; sometimes it takes place as a  [recreational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreation "Recreation")  activity. Recreational shopping often involves  [window shopping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_shopping "Window shopping")  and browsing: it does not always result in a purchase.

Retail markets and shops have a very ancient history, dating back to antiquity. Some of the earliest retailers were itinerant  [peddlers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peddler "Peddler"). Over the centuries, retail shops were transformed from little more than "rude booths" to the sophisticated shopping malls of the modern era.

Most modern retailers typically make a variety of  [strategic level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_strategy "Corporate strategy")  decisions including the type of  [store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retail_shop "Retail shop"), the  [market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_(economics) "Market (economics)")  to be served, the optimal  [product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(business) "Product (business)")  assortment,  [customer service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_service "Customer service"), supporting services and the store's overall market positioning. Once the strategic retail plan is in place, retailers devise the retail mix which includes product, price, place, promotion, personnel and presentation. In the  [digital age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_age "Digital age"), an increasing number of retailers are seeking to reach broader markets by selling through multiple channels, including both  [bricks and mortar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bricks_and_mortar_store "Bricks and mortar store")  and  [online retailing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_shopping "Online shopping"). Digital technologies are also changing the way that  [consumers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer "Consumer")  pay for goods and services. Retailing support services may also include the provision of credit, delivery services, advisory services, stylist services and a range of other supporting services.

Retail shops occur in a diverse range of types and in many different contexts – from  [strip shopping centres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strip_mall "Strip mall")  in  [residential streets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residential_area "Residential area")  through to large, indoor  [shopping malls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shopping_mall "Shopping mall").  [Shopping streets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shopping_streets "Shopping streets")  may restrict traffic to pedestrians only. Sometimes a shopping street has a partial or full  [roof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roof "Roof")  to create a more comfortable shopping environment – protecting customers from various types of weather conditions such as extreme temperatures, winds or  [precipitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation_(meteorology) "Precipitation (meteorology)"). Forms of non-shop retailing include online retailing (a type of  **electronic-commerce**  used for  **business-to-consumer**  (**B2C**) transactions) and  [mail order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail_order "Mail order").
